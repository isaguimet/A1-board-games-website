            <div>
                <p>In this page, we compare the board games on 4 characteristics: number of players allowed to play the game,
                    game duration, game complexity, and game type.
                    Note: These games have been picked by me, Isabella Guimet, since these are the games that have been the
                    most successful when hosting game nights at my house.

                    <p>When choosing games to play, ideally, you can start picking up games from increasing complexity until your group gets
                        more comfortable by playing longer and more complex games.

                        Below I will list for which groups of friends, each game would be a hit
                        and recommend a game for each category.</p>

                        <li><b>Sushi-Go!:</b> Best for people who want to play an easy and quick game. For people that enjoy playing card games,
                            such as UNO and Phase 10, this game would be a fun addition to their collection.<br>
