                <p>In this 2-4 player cooperative game, you and your teammates will travel across the globe, treating infections while
                    finding resources for cures. Meanwhile, there will be outbreaks happening all around the globe!
                    <br><br>
                    In this game, the goal is to cure the four deadly diseases. Meanwhile, there are 3 ways to lose:
                    <ul>
                        <li>8 outbreaks occur (a worldwide panic happens)</li>
                        <li>not enough disease cubes are left when needed (a disease spreads too much)</li>
                        <li>not enough player cards are left when needed (your team runs out of time)</li>
                    </ul>
                <p> You must work together using your individual strengths to succeed. There are 7 role cards you and your team can play as such as
                    researcher, operations expert, scientist, dispatcher, quarantine specialist, contingency planner and medic.
                </p>
