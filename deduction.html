        <p>Here we will take a look at a sneaky bluffing deduction game. This game is set in a not too distant future where the government is run
            for profit by corrupt CEOs. Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a few privileged lives to poverty and desperation.
            You are one of the powerful government officials that needs to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power.
            Will your bluffing skills be good enough to overthrow the government? Introducing:

                <p>In this 2-6 player game, your main objective is to be the last player standing by destroying the influence of all the other players. An influence is represented
                    by face-down character cards in your playing area. Each of these influences have unique set of powers such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Contessa:</b> Block an assassination attempt against yourself.</li>
                        <li><b>Assassin:</b> Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.</li>
                        <li><b>Captain:</b> Steal two coins from another player. Block someone from stealing coins from you.</li>
                        <li><b>Duke:</b> Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.</li>
                        <li><b>Ambassador:</b> Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters,
                            then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each turn, a player must play an action. An action is divided by non-influence actions or influence actions. Non-influence actions include taking an income of
                        1 coin from the treasury, taking 2 coins of foreign aid from the treasury or paying 7 coins for a coup (choose a player to lose an influence).
                        Note: if you have more than 10+ coins, you must coup!<br><br>
                        Now, the fun part begins if choosing
                        influence actions. A player can choose any influence's (character card) action by bluffing. Any player in the game can challenge you if they think you are bluffing.
                        If you are NOT bluffing and someone challenges you then
                        the person who challenged you loses an influence. If you were bluffing, and you don't have the influence you claim to have then you lose an influence.
                        The game continues until there is one person standing.
