    <h3> So you want to host a board games night? You've come to the right place!</h3>
    <p>How do you have a successful games night?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Invite the right number of people to play:</b>
            Most games have a minimum of 3 players up to a maximum of 8 players. This is not your usual house party meaning
            that inviting more than 10 people will have many people waiting their turn to play games which is not ideal.
        </li>
        <li><b>Make your guests comfortable:</b>
            Ideally, you should play your games on a stable table. The table should be large enough to place all components
            of the game. Make sure the seats are comfortable. Lastly, provide food and drinks <i>before</i>
            you start the game. This way, your board games won't have food or drink stains on them.
        </li>
        <li><b>Ideally learn the rules prior to starting a game:</b> making yourself familiar with the rules of the games
            means you can have more time playing the game rather than spend precious time learning the game during your game
            night.
        </li>
        <li><b>Choose the right games for your group:</b> this website will suggest some fun party games you can play with your
            group! Choosing the right games can make or break your board game night. For example, for beginners to board games,
            I would not suggest to play a 2hr game with complex mechanics.
        </li>
        <li><b>Remember to have fun and enjoy!</b></li>
    </ul>
