                <p>In this quick and fun 2-5 player game, you are eating at a sushi restaurant and trying to grab the best
                    combination of sushi dishes as they come by. In this game, you score points for grabbing the most maki rolls or for collecting a full set of sashimi.
                    The game is played in 3 rounds and lasts about 15 minutes. The person who has the most points wins!

                    This is a pick and pass card game where each round players
                    simultaneously choose any 1 card from their hands that they would like to keep and place it face-down in front of
                    them. When each player has done this, everyone reveals their chosen cards and pass their remaining hand face-down
                    to the left. The round continues until their hand is empty.
